vuejs learning:
..will look into code evolution youtube and offical website.
concepts:
what is vuejs?
.a popular js frame work for building user interfaces.
.it focused on doing one thing really well which is buildong user interfaces.
.it does not focus on ther aspects where it ues plugins for those tasks for this vuejs has a 
rich eco system that can be used like :
vuex for the store management and vuetify for the ul elements  and vue router for routing
 why vuejs?
. vue is approachable.....
. vue js component based
. vuejs is declarative
. vuejs is a framework build by taking some other frameworks and develop where necessary


<10 features>
Project structure :
understand how the controlflows
Package.json: dependcies and scripts.
nodemodules: it is the folder where are dependencies are installed
index.html: is the only html file present here , we are building a SPA
we have a div with id ="app" it is responsible for the UI
src: main.js here we specify the Root Component (i.e APP component) and 
the dom element which will be controlled by the vue , here the DOM element is #app it is called 
RootDomNode:every thing inside it is controlled by it.
>.vue extension is a file where we specify html,csss and js corresponding to a portion  of the UI we see on the borwser.
.Vue file: is a custom file format which uses the html like syntax to display the UI
<template>html of the UI defines the structure
<script>where the logic and fucntionality of your app can be maintained
<style> css for the template
instead of deviding them into three united for a single format in a file
Components: in .vue file is called a sfc and folder is called Components.

<<< Things to learn with one .vue file: >>>
Tempalte Syntax-->
 - responsible for the markup
.Working with .vue file is wiring up the ligic to the markuo
.that is connecting data present in the script block to the HTML present in the template block-- Declarative Approach.
.let the vue know how you want to bind the data to the HTML and vue will take care of the rest.
>>>Binding text from script to template: MusthachSyntax  {{ }} - this method of binding data is called TextInterPolation
. the Directive used for binding text is v-text="name". the only drawback of it is it replace the entire conntent of the HTML element withe data property value.

SUMMARY: in vue js we haev 2 ways to bind the txt  {{ }}[bind partial or full context ]and v-text [only full context but fast and rarely used ] but v-text has a drawback

V-HTMl Directive: when we want to render sometext that is either with  <b> or<i> 
ex: name: <b>sreekanth</b> when we use the above two {{}}, v-text is displayed as <b>sreekanth</b> but not shown on the screen in bold letters
but here if u use v-html is render as SREEKANTH.

Binding Attributes:
v-bind: we can add data id and class using this
rendering a list of elements and we want each to haev identical id we can use v-bind
v-bind: binding to boolean data=> isDiasbled=true
<button v-bind:disabled="isDisabeld">Bind</button>
if disabled is true the disabled attributecan be seen in inspect if the disabled is false then we can see it in the inspect.
binding the classes: use the underlinr ex -- this is can be done if the styling is static
Binding classes pending for night(practice).

Binding-styles:
binding of sytles can be done in two ways array and object syntax.

data==> hightlight:'orange',headerSize:50
<h2 v-bind:style="{color:hightlight}">SreeKanth</h2>
minor details is that the fontsize is a multi word so we have to keep it in qoutes as below
and as it is a number we need to adad the px at the end
<h2 v-bind:style="{
color:hightlight,
'font-size':headerSize + 'px' or fontSize:headerSize + 'px'
}">SreeKanth</h2>


id ,class etla sree and kanth vunnay anuko manam aa value ni data la declare cheysi and v-bind directive tho
id and class attributes ki values esthey inspect cheysi nappudu manaki aa value osthadi
data=>sree:'myId'
<h2 v-bind:id='sree'>sreekanth_k</h2>
not all values to be dynamic we can also give like this
<h2 v-bind:style="{
color:hightlight,
'font-size':headerSize + 'px' or fontSize:headerSize + 'px',
paddding:'20px'
}">SreeKanth</h2>

writing this way is good but for neat code we should use this way by declaring the object in the data
data=> headerStyleObject:{
color:'red',
fontSize:'50px',
padding:'20px'
}
<h2v-bind:style="headerStyleObject">StyleObject</h2>

now lets look at the array syntax
